# Curve25519
A small framework to use Curve25519 functions in Swift.

## Purpose

I created this framework to provide a Swift API to the Elliptic Curve functions needed for the Signal Protocol. It encapsules the pure C implementation found in [libsignal-protocol-c](https://github.com/signalapp/libsignal-protocol-c).

The framework is used with my [Swift implementation](https://github.com/christophhagen/SignalProtocolSwift) of the [Signal Protocol](https://signal.org/docs/).

## Installation

The framework can be installed by using [Cocoapods](https://cocoapods.org/). Include in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
pod 'Curve25519'
```

## Usage

Once the Framework is included in your project, simply

```swift
import Curve25519
```

All features are available through static functions of the `Curve25519` class, for example:

```swift
let agreement = Curve25519.calculateAgreement(privateKey: priv, publicKey: pub)
```

## Features

The framework provides the following features:

### Creating public keys for private keys

Create the corresponding public key for a 32 byte private key.

```swift
func publicKey(for privateKey: Data, basepoint: Data) throws -> Data
```

The function will return nil if the inputs have the wrong size.

### Signing and verifying messages

It is possible to sign a message with a private key, and then verify the message with a public key.

```swift
func signature(for message: Data, privateKey: Data, randomData: Data) throws -> Data

func verify(signature: Data, for message: Data, publicKey: Data) -> Bool
```

### VRF signature and verification

Additionally it is possible to create and verify VRF (Verifiable Random Function) signatures.

```swift
func vrfSignature(for message: Data, privateKey: Data, randomData: Data) throws -> Data

func verify(vrfSignature: Data, for message: Data, publicKey: Data) throws -> Data
```

### Key agreement

Create a shared secret between a private and a public key.

```swift
func calculateAgreement(privateKey: Data, publicKey: Data) throws -> Data
```

## Errors

Some of the functions can throw errors if the inputs are invalid. All errors thrown for these
functions are of type `CurveError`, which is an `enum` that conforms to the `CustomStringConvertible`
protocol. This makes it easy to check for the errors in code, and to print them for debugging.


## Directly using C functions

Additionally all C functions are exposed directly for use:

```swift
// Public key creation
func curve25519_donna(_ pub: UnsafeMutablePointer<UInt8>!,
                      _ priv: UnsafePointer<UInt8>!,
                      _ base: UnsafePointer<UInt8>!) -> Int32

// Signing
func curve25519_sign(
                  _ signature_out: UnsafeMutablePointer<UInt8>!,
                  _ curve25519_privkey: UnsafePointer<UInt8>!,
                  _ msg: UnsafePointer<UInt8>!,
                  _ msg_len: UInt,
                  _ random: UnsafePointer<UInt8>!) -> Int32

// Verification
func curve25519_verify(
                  _ signature: UnsafePointer<UInt8>!,
                  _ curve25519_pubkey: UnsafePointer<UInt8>!,
                  _ msg: UnsafePointer<UInt8>!,
                  _ msg_len: UInt) -> Int32

// VRF signature
func generalized_xveddsa_25519_sign(
                  _ signature_out: UnsafeMutablePointer<UInt8>!,
                  _ x25519_privkey_scalar: UnsafePointer<UInt8>!,
                  _ msg: UnsafePointer<UInt8>!,
                  _ msg_len: UInt,
                  _ random: UnsafePointer<UInt8>!,
                  _ customization_label: UnsafePointer<UInt8>!,
                  _ customization_label_len: UInt) -> Int32

// VRF verification
func generalized_xveddsa_25519_verify(
                  _ vrf_out: UnsafeMutablePointer<UInt8>!,
                  _ signature: UnsafePointer<UInt8>!,
                  _ x25519_pubkey_bytes: UnsafePointer<UInt8>!,
                  _ msg: UnsafePointer<UInt8>!,
                  _ msg_len: UInt,
                  _ customization_label: UnsafePointer<UInt8>!,
                  _ customization_label_len: UInt) -> Int32

// Agreement
func curve25519_donna(_ shared: UnsafeMutablePointer<UInt8>!,
                      _ priv: UnsafePointer<UInt8>!,
                      _ pub: UnsafePointer<UInt8>!) -> Int32
```

## Documentation

The project is documented heavily because it helps other people understand the code. The [documentation](https://github.com/christophhagen/Curve25519/tree/master/Documentation)
is created with [jazzy](https://github.com/realm/jazzy), which creates awesome, apple-like
docs.

The docs can be (re-)generated by running the following in the project directory:

```
jazzy --min-acl private -a 'Christoph Hagen' -u 'https://github.com/christophhagen' -g 'https://github.com/christophhagen/Curve25519' -o 'Documentation'
```
